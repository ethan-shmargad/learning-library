# Identify the connections to the EMPLOYEESEARCH_PROD schema

## Introduction

In this lab, we will explore creating a realm in our ATP instance. We will keep our realm in **simulation mode**. In turn, this will enable us to capture a record of errors during the development phase of a realm or command rule. Using simulation mode, we will then identify our connections to the `EMPLOYEESEARCH_PROD` schema.

### Objectives

In this lab, you will complete the following tasks:

- Create a Database Vault realm.
- Use **simulation mode** to identify the connections to the `EMPLOYEESEARCH_PROD` schema (app versus non-app connections).

### Prerequisites

This lab assumes you have:
- An Oracle Always Free/Free Tier, Paid or LiveLabs Cloud Account

## Task 1: Create a Database Vault realm

## Task 2: Use simulation mode to identify the connections to the EMPLOYEESEARCH_PROD schema

You may now **proceed to the next lab.**
