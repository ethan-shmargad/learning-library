# Explore the Glassfish HR application functions with Database Vault enabled 

## Introduction

In this lab, we will now flip our Database Vault Realm from **simulation** to **enforcement** mode. This will commit our realm into production. Then, we will put our realm to the test and demonstrate the inability to query the application data under a particular user.


### Objectives

In this lab, you will complete the following tasks:

- Flip the Database Vault realm from **simulation** to **enforcement** mode
- Explore the application and demonstrate the inability to query application data through Database Actions

## Task 1: Flip the Database Vault realm from simulation to enforcement mode
